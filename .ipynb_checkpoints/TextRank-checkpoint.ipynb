is.', 'I mean just to try it and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo Um So I guess that's what we need to aim for.\", 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Well if I guess I mean that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.', 'So I guess I know.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Alright.', 'Say that again, O_ four.', 'Oh yeah.', 'Mm.', 'Okay.', 'I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two.', \"Oh um I don't know.\", \"I basi I s started like browsing a bit, just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just yeah, searching, yeah well yeah.\", \"We're doing the.\", 'Yeah, yeah.', \"So it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing, but I haven't read it yet.\", 'But Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"Yeah, well I don't know if it's usable.\", 'I uh can have a look th at it.', 'But but I found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing.', 'Uh whatever.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"Um yeah, I guess that's it.\", \"I don't know.\", \"Uh I'm I was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files.\", 'I mean uh how much do we actually need to do.', 'Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing?', 'Okay.', 'Okay.', 'What are you writing in Java or yeah, okay.', 'Yeah.', 'you know a bunch about file things.', 'Um yeah, I guess I mean it was a good point you had that like

don't know, see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe?\", 'Or what do we need.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yep.', 'Yeah.', 'Well Yep.', 'Oh.', \"Um Yeah, we're gonna meet up.\", 'Yeah.', \"'Cause it's now Okay.\", 'Okay.', 'But it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query?', \"Or is it just what's behind it?\", 'So or how does it work then?', 'D Okay.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', 'When you like you is there a open thingy or Like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses N_X_T_

comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics.\", 'And then when you go on the menu, you can select a summarisation box, which pops up, and an audio player.', 'Um and a s I think the search works as well, so you could pop up a search.', 'And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start, you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that.', 'Does that make sense?', \"Um the transcription box has got a summarise but button, which doesn't do anything yet.\", 'Um now I wonder wh how we wanna do, you know, we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation.', 'Um either we could do that you know, when does the pop-up come?', 'Either we can when you click on the the I_D_, any sort of I_D_ in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box, but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is.', \"The problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying, you know, the the left-click highlights it.\", \"So that you can I don't know what happens when you double-click actually, but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else.\", 'Um I think so yeah, when you left-click it, you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there, I think.', \"Um so we can't put it on left-click.\", 'We could put it on a right-click.', 'We could for example have a little menu that pops up.', 'So right-click on at menu, you know, and you can click on speaker characterisation, up pops the window.', \"That's a good point.\", \"I don't know.\", 'Nothing else.', \"Yeah, yeah, but um I don't know about you, but uh usually in Windows right-click doesn't do anything, does it?\", 'It opens a menu.', 'Yeah, so yeah.', \"So but that'd be yeah.\", 'If you just yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Um or just, you know, or just the button.', 'Well no no, you still have the menu the menu pop up that Well oh, yeah.', \"It's more obvious, isn't it, w what you can do.\", 'Yeah.', \"Yeah, that's right.\", \"That's true, yeah, it's more intuitive really, isn't it?\", 'Maybe, maybe.', 'In the beta version.', 'Um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in.', 'Like a search for that user.', 'Is that gonna be useful or too much?', 'Or Yeah, so y when you right-click on it, one one option will be give me all your meetings, characterise the speaker Or is that too much I mean?',

with all the meetings that contain that.', 'Yeah?', 'So we could do that in a similar way, do it right-click as well.', 'And to have a different menu for our Yeah.', 'So yeah.', 'So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations.', 'And when then we have the interlinking by right-click basically.', 'Double-click Oh.', 'Hmm.',

extremely organised, you see.\", \"I've got folders for everything.\", 'I love folders.', \"Yep, so that's me done.\", 'Someone else wanna talk about their stuff?', 'Mm-hmm.', 'W what where you doing again?', 'The search, okay.', 'Okay.', 'Indexing.', 'Oh.', 'Oh right.', \"Oh that's pretty much there, is it?\", 'Of making Oh great.', \"Yeah, that's handy.\", \"So you think it shouldn't be too difficult?\", 'Oh, I see.', 'Yeah.', 'You have to convert it to some sort of format, I suppose.', 'I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then, because um, you know, they already extract for example transcripts.', 'Put it into a window at least.', 'What do you mean?', \"This week's only two days old.\", 'Oh.', 'Yeah.', \"Oh that's complete rubbish anyway.\", 'Never mind.', 'Just so stupid.', 'Mm-hmm.', \"Well ye the browser as I use it now or as uh, you know, it was there when I took it um uses the um the N_X_T_ search to get the data out of the out the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works yet.\", \"I don't quite understand it.\", 'To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data, you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"So they don't, you know, they don't say look in that and that folder, but they say search everything.\", 'Oh it does load up quite quickly.', \"So you know, it's not too bad.\", 'But you know, you could have a look at them.', 'No, this is not the actual search.', \"This is just when you open what you know, to load the transcript for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting, it does does an N_X_T_ search for the string, I don't know, transcript or text or whatever.\", 'Yeah.', \"Yeah, so I don't know if you've looked at the search query s language, but it's like a dollar A_ text say.\", 'Yeah.', 'And then yeah.', 'Because every every of all of these um these files have got um tha an I_D_.', \"And all the transcript files have got the string, I don't know what it is, words or text or something in it, so it just searches for those files.\", 'Vaguely.', 'So Open.', \"Um um well, it's in the code.\", 'Just that it, you know, it yeah, you define a search object, and then you search on that string.', 'I had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary.', \"That's how I I had to I had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself.\", 'Yeah, just search for a specific string.', 'So you could just, you know, you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere.', 'Yeah.', 'If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna, you know, whatever you wanna do, then just send me an email.', 'I can explain it.', 'Oh yeah.', \"Actually, in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that I used from this from you know, that they gave us, had a lot of extra stuff in, and I haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions I haven't you know, that I don't need.\", 'Yeah, just in case.', 'Exactly.', 'Yes.', \"So they're all in there ye still.\", 'A lot of rubbish, but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end, I think.', 'Yes.', 'Exactly, yes.', 'Yeah.', 'Precisely.', 'The weekend?', \"The weekend's still four days off.\", 'Oh.',

'You do.', \"Well, I'll do that then.\", 'Shall I do that then?', \"I mean Or you know It shouldn't be to difficult.\", \"I mean Well I'm doing communications, which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.\", \"And that's in in two weeks.\", \"Yeah, it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something.\", 'Yeah.', \"And then then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well, and that's in like Friday.\", \"Well I'm not doing any background reading, so you know.\", 'Being lazy.', 'Oh.', 'Yeah, if you like.', 'We can always decide then, I mean yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then?', \"You're gonna do the search.\", \"You're gonna implement the search.\", 'Everything?', 'Mm-hmm.', \"It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones, because otherwise You know Weeks will go by and Well you decide, I'm not doing much for that prototype.\", 'So Of Oh.', 'Well, how about we get it done by then?', \"I mean Then we can write about it in the in the interim report, and s you know, and then we've got something to show.\", 'Um oh and the the search interface.', 'Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for.', \"And then if you want, you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice, you know, a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus.\", 'No.', \"Oh that's that's that doesn't exist.\", \"Tha that's completely cut and pasted.\", 'That does not exist.', \"Nicely done though, isn't it?\", \"It's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know, all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from Google online.\", 'A screen-shot of Google.', \"It's just so much fun.\", \"It's gonna be a little difficult more difficult.\", 'Yeah, I mean I was going to, but you know, the whole drop-down menus and stuff, what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on.', 'We never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for.', 'So Yeah, do you wanna, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do, and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include?', 'That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do.', 'Know Know already what?', 'Oh.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah, I can do that.', 'Show you what bits the code Yeah.', 'Ah, yeah.', \"Well this time I'm dictating the time, 'cause I if I'm not there you can't do anything.\", \"Yeah, ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it, you know.\", 'I mean Pick a time.', 'I I you know, let me know, whenever.', 'What Monday.', 'What did you say?', \"Three o'clock.\", 'Actually th yeah.', 'Unless you wanna do it after the um after D_ D_ and A_.', \"That's gonna be tight.\", 'Yeah, it what front door?', \"I've not found that yet.\", 'Really?', 'Really?', 'Ah.', \"Well, I'm just I've got it in my computer.\", 'Whatever is in my computer.', \"I just think it's better to do it afterwards.\", 'Then we have all the time we need.', \"Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out.\", 'Oh.', \"Actually it's not even confirmed yet.\", \"What was She doesn't even know what she's talking about yet, I think.\", \"Maybe it doesn't happen at all.\", 'Is it really?', 'Really?', \"I don't think we have a reading week though.\", \"The the Yeah, I don't think there is an official I don't think there was an official one last semester.\", \"I think it was just a bank holiday, wasn't it?\", 'No, Okay.', \"Let's meet Monday.\", 'Hmm?', 'Right.', 'I think we need to tick the okay box, right?', 'Ooh.', 'Exciting.', 'Should we turn these off then or what?', 'Funky sh stuff like that.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Look at all this stuff man.', 'Okay.', 'Right.', 'Has anybody Has anybody done anything?', 'You better start.', 'Good at this.', 'Right.', 'D yeah.', 'The l the left-click or the right-click.', 'Right.', 'Yeah, it might be quite good, I suppose.', 'Yeah.', 'What else could we have in the menu?', 'Okay.', 'So otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have have a Is a window.', 'A menu, yeah yeah.', \"Yeah, it's why.\", 'And so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"It's more It's more idiot proof, isn't it.\", \"It's got a button.\", 'Add more buttons.', 'Yeah.', \"Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one, you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah.\", 'Yep.', 'I guess so.', 'So what did you part of the m the menu that comes down, it says give me all your meetings or something.', 'Yep.', 'I guess so.', \"It's an idea.\", 'Get to use my pen.', 'Yeah yeah.', 'Oh yeah.', 'We have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges.', 'So yeah, there you go.', 'Yeah.', 'Alright.', 'Why not.', 'Even if only one thing comes up.', 'Okay.', 'So and so this lot is for um On the t speaker.', 'And then this lot is on th What was that?', \"I didn't quite understand.\", 'Do you mean Yeah.', \"Oh, so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click.\", 'Oh.', 'Okay.', 'Yeah.', 'Sometimes you do it by accident though.', 'You, oh go away.', 'Stop coming up.', 'Yeah.', 'No.', 'Yeah, yeah, oh yeah.', 'T throw stuff throwing out the window.', 'Yep.', \"We don't know yet do we, I don't think.\", 'Do you mean the single channel?', 'Probably not, but we might need them for disfluencies, if we try do it in audio.', 'But at the moment, no.', 'But yeah.', \"We might want to be able to say oh, just give me what that person's saying.\", \"Unless um you can't hear it properly or something.\", \"Somebody's talking over somebody else or something.\", 'Well p W we just say no for now and put it in later or something.', 'Yeah, yeah.', \"Yeah, 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot, won't it?\", 'Therefore print will be bigger.', 'Yeah.', \"No, I think it's I think it's fine.\", 'Yeah.', \"I think what we're doing is fine.\", 'Yeah, tabs are good.', 'Mozilla style.', 'Yeah.', 'Does anybody know how to do that?', 'Or can you do that in Java?', \"I don't think Java knows how to do that really.\", 'Maybe yeah, you probably can.', \"But but

got loads, and you're always g forever going no, get out of the way.\", \"There's always stuff in the way, isn't there.\", 'So Yeah.', 'You do, yeah?', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', \"Unless, can you I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that Can you can you do that?\", \"Okay, well it's alright then.\", 'Yeah.', \"Of course you can actually, yeah, it's got everything.\", 'Yeah, sounds good.', \"Um Yeah, that's what we need, yeah.\", 'Something just slightly more than just that on its own.', 'Yep.', 'Yep, definitely.', \"I think that's kinda as well, isn't it really?\", 'Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be a prototype with a GUI.', 'Yeah, yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'You can make it if you make it world readable, then anybody can access it.', 'Yeah.', \"No, uh i i it no, they're not world-readable.\", \"It not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default.\", \"You can see them but you can't read them.\", 'Yeah.', \"What's your

it as is rather than the proper week, do you know what I mean.', \"Do you know that, it's been all a bit manic, the last m the last yeah.\", \"Yeah, that's right, yeah.\", 'And then we had to do an I_R_P_, whatever it was last week as well.', \"Which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page.\", \"More diffi it was, it wasn't marked, but it was I had to sit there and think about it for a bit, which is a bit irritating.\", 'Yeah, but S_P_N_L_P_.', 'Yeah.', 'Yep.', \"So when it when it That's pretty bizarre, isn't it?\", \"Well I guess that's how it works.\", \"They've got d That is pretty bizarre.\", 'Yeah, yeah.', 'That is pretty bizarre.', \"Wh Four, and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list, whatever, find everything that's got that and then

explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising.', 'You saw it, yeah.', 'So what courses should I pick to be not doing any work at the moment?', 'Yeah.', \"Oh, so it's uh, yeah.\", 'Yeah, me too.', 'Um.', \"So so what's that, two weeks basically.\", 'Ish yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', \"Yeah, that's it's quite impressive actually.\", 'Yeah.', \"That's quite slow really.\", 'Yeah.', \"No, it's not, is it?\", 'Yeah.', 'Can take us for a tutorial sometime.', 'Next week sometime.', 'Mm Monday afternoon.', 'Uh Three is alright.', \"It was what time's D_N_L_G_?\", \"Four, isn't it?\",

here.\", \"Well if you find me, I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there, and we can all go in there.\", 'Yeah, yeah.', 'You do need to have a key for it.', \"Like that's the thing.\", \"It's got a lock door button.\", 'Yeah, somebody will answer it.', \"Yeah, it's only got it's crap, it's only got about four or five computers in But it would do quite good for our job, 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often.\", \"Yeah, there's fridge there.\", \"And there's a photo-copier with the code on it, yeah yeah.\", \"It's cool, yeah.\", 'Oh right.', 'Yeah, yeah.',

extensible ', 'like if we wanna add more things in the future  then we have to well  new buttons ', 'i don t know ', 'whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way ', 'but we re probably not gonna be adding too many things ', 'okay  exactly ', 'i know  i know ', 'true  true ', 'yes ', 'hmm ', 'hmm ', 'yeah ', 'actually  yeah  but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well ', 'i mean speaker characterisation tied into i don t know ', 'di just some way to sort of leverage that information ', 'like we have it  we re doing it  but what how does it help the browsing ', 'or what can it give us in the browsing ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'hmm ', 'right ', 'yeah ', 'true  yeah ', 'is that just from the main main window ', 'is that is that from any particular window  like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something  have a right click from for these various things to yeah ', 'right  yeah ', 'yep ', 'okay  yeah ', 'now it s consistent throughout ', 'so  yeah ', 'right ', 'actually yeah  like um another common thing  like if we have it so it s set up that um if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu  i mean that s kind of a typical kinda action that would happen ', 'if you double click on a particular topic or something  then it goes to sort of a like a default view  so it ll be like all the um cases of that topic  either whatever we decide the default to be  whether it s in all meetings or just in one meeting  and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting ', 'like i m just thinking to have the default there  so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that s the most common thing that s gonna happen  so the double click will do that and so save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu ', 'well  it might come to us as we start playing with it ', 'um like we have the the right click menu ', 'you ll have the menu  right click it  but instead of like have a default double click  so if there s a de so it ll be a choice from the menu but yeah  exactly ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'hmm ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'hmm ', 'yeah  exactly ', 'well then they close it ', 'yeah ', 'you know  it s not it s not the end of the world ', 'yeah  ', 'yeah ', 'okay   hmm ', 'mm ', 'well  yeah ', 'mm hmm ', 'i think we probably need that  though to have the f the full flexibility  we need to have that there  but um yeah ', 'mm hmm ', 'although the thing is typically though  is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time  probably not ', 'probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they re looking at  like dialogue acts  to whatever  characterisations ', 'hmm ', 'yeah  true ', 'hmm ', 'so like have a tab there ', 'for something like that choose on choose one ', 'yeah ', 'oh you should be able to ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  or even just have buttons on it  toggle buttons or something on the tool bar for that window ', 'just something ', 'a lot of different ways we can do it  it doesn t doesn t have to be a tab or whatever ', 'just gonna be yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'exactly ', 'or check marks ', 'even have two of  em checked and send yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  exactly ', 'yeah ', 'mm hmm ', 'yeah ', 'true ', 'oh yeah ', 'okay ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  like a lot of these can be  like once we get the disfluencies out  then we can you know  have transcript without the disfluency  transcript with the disfluent disfluency ', 'have all these  you know  have all these sort of using the same

we need to discuss ', 'did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week ', 'well  i dunno ', 'we ll probably get some work done over the weekend  so i dunno if after d n l g  or something  maybe just have a little quick little update and just yeah ', 'well we can decide ', 'yeah  exactly ', 'true ', 'yeah ', 'search ', 'and well sure  why not ', 'couldn t be that hard ', 'well  it ll be  you know  still limited version of  you know  the next query search ', 'but  no no ', 'won t be the whole thing then ', 'um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do ', 'hmm ', 'yeah ', 'well  actually most are just dialogue acts ', 'and what else was there   summary topic yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  it ll get behind schedule  yeah  pretty quick ', 'like you re saying  yeah ', 'well actually  do we wanna set a date for interim prototype ', 'specifically a date ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'is it semblance of reality ', 'yeah ', 'i see ', 'right  true ', 'mm decide on that on over the weekend ', 'yeah ', 'right ', 'yeah  totally ', 'oh  just like the basic ', 'so like no ', 'sorry ', 'yeah ', 'just like all the and seeing the code  and just sort of how just see the basics of what you ve done ', 'like just get a a quick look over and just the basics ', 'yeah ', 'or like like  you know  the class paths all that sort of thing ', 'like just just say okay  well here s you know  everything s basic in set up and then just yeah  just jump right in ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'that s cool ', 'yeah ', 'in the morning ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  i know ', 'well thing is  you know  if yeah  something like that could happen anytime  cause uh yeah  like my schedule s like a class  break  class  break  class  you know  that sort of thing ', 'so so yeah  i know  exactly  exactly  that s what i m thinking ', 'so something like that and then if i have a class i can run off and do whatever ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'actually monday  monday might be good d um ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'anytime um  not at n not at noon or two or four ', 'no  in between those is you know  like one or three or sure ', 'possibly ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  that s an option too ', 'yeah  after ', 'sure ', 'that s fine ', 'yeah ', 'or three thirty ', 'no  just yeah ', 'that d be necessarily necessarily short ', 'actually we can t get in there though ', 'w we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door ', 'yeah ', 'how about if we take uh a tour ', 'yeah  right ', 'yeah  yeah  exactly ', 'okay ', 'just sort bang on it ', 'actually i was asking steve about that  whether we can get in there ', 'whether he was gonna get us access into the the computer room ', 'yeah  print okay ', 'right ', 'is there a printer in there too ', 'a nice okay ', 'that would come in handy  yeah ', 'hey  we could we could photo copy our um assignment if we wanted to ', 'yeah ', 'well the comments i m thinking ', 'um yeah  that s true ', 'so after d n l g  ', 'yeah ', 'as long as d n l g  doesn t go late ', 'oh ', 'so sounds like me ', 'are you ', 'next week ', 'or the week ', 'how ', 'oh ', 'yeah ', 'that s cancelled ', 'oh really ', 'hmm ', 'um something like that ', 'i think one or couple classes were cancelled ', 'yeah ', 'exact yeah ', 'i th yeah ', 'i think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not ', 'well  i don t feel like teaching ', 'yeah  okay ', 'i think yeah ', 'i think d i l  will probably have one to make up for missing classes ', 'd i l  will probably have classes  yeah ', 'yep ', 'you can have it ', 'yeah ', 'huh ', 'which one  the top one ', 'um do you really want multiple windows from a single lap ', 'but most will probably want to go with defaults ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'you d be s yeah  exactly  and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation ', 'yeah  yeah that s about it ', 'nothing terribly exciting ', 'okay ', 'yeah ', 'alright ', 'okay ', 'so okay ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'okay ', 'so what do we need to talk about ', 'yeah ', 'uh yeah ', 'good start ', 'oh  i don t mind as well ', 'this wasn t a good start ', 'okay ', 'sorry ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'can you use double click or yeah  i don t know ', 'yeah ', 'and then i guess a button button makes a bit more sense   cause otherwise you don t really know that  oh  what if i right click now  what happens then ', 'it s like more if it s visual ', 'yeah ', 'do you see my yeah ', 'but well  we we can have both  but whatever ', 'yeah  um i don t i mean it w it s more like part of the browsing sort of thingy ', 'more than the speaker characterisation  as m steve mentioned ', 'um  i don t really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing ', 'yeah  well yeah ', 'i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like  well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic  and then if you  i don t know  click on that topic  you get everything that s in that topic or whatever ', 'and in that way but i don t know ', 'no no no ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'uh just let th yep ', 'yeah ', 'like  i don t know  show the speaker characterisation for instance ', 'or just i don t know ', 'but if you do double click on something  don t you expect something to happen then ', 'sort of well  i don t know ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  uh that was good start ', 'i don t know ', 'i guess it depends on the yeah  what you re clicking on ', 'obviously ', 'single channel ', 'no ', 'no ', 'yeah ', 'but uh well  couldn t we i mean you probably i don t know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time ', 'so maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'tabs are nice ', 'i like tabs ', 'yeah ', 'i don t know how easy it is ', 'but i dunno  but yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'or just  i don t know ', 'yeah  uh change the contents of the same window  like from transcription to summary ', 'probably yeah ', 'hmm ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'that could probably no  no  it could be like transcription summary  like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'i don t like pop ups ', 'i guess that yeah ', 'yeah ', 'he s close ', 'yeah  um well could uh i don t know ', 'would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then ', 'like full meeting  meeting without disfluencies  and summarise ', 'yeah ', 'um yeah ', 'i guess it is ', 'i mean just to try it and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo um so i guess that s what we need to aim for ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention  but we might not have written it down ', 'so i guess i know ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'alright ', 'say that again  o  four ', 'oh yeah ', 'mm ', 'okay ', 'i could tell you what i done in s p  two ', 'oh um i don t know ', 'i basi i s started like browsing a bit  just like trying to see if there s anything out there to use s sort of um just yeah  searching  yeah well yeah ', 'we re doing the ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'so it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing  but i haven t read it yet ', 'but yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  well i don t know if it s usable ', 'i uh can have a look th at it ', 'but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing ', 'uh whatever ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'um yeah  i guess that s it ', 'i don t know ', 'uh i m i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files ', 'i mean uh how much do we actually need to do ', 'like extracting things from the x m l  files and stuff to be able to do the indexing ', 'okay ', 'okay ', 'what are you writing in java or yeah  okay ', 'yeah ', 'you know a bunch about file things ', 'um yeah  i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things ', 'i mean if you already started on on doing your stuff  i guess we can yeah ', 'yeah ', 'should we  i don t know  meet up and see what we could do ', 'i mean  i don t know  see what you ve done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe ', 'or what do we need ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yep ', 'yeah ', 'well yep ', 'oh ', 'um yeah  we re gonna meet up ', 'yeah ', ' cause it s now okay ', 'okay ', 'but it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query ', 'or is it just what s behind it ', 'so or how does it work then ', 'd okay ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'when you like you is there a open thingy or like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses n x t  search like is it okay ', 'okay ', 'yeah ', 'mm hmm ', 'yeah ', 'oh yeah ', 'yeah ', 'oh no ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'mm ', 'i don t know ', 'oh ', 'oh ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'that s nice ', 'sorry ', 'i m just being yeah ', 'hmm ', 'have we these courses that we re okay ', 'yeah ', 'no ', 'i don yeah ', 'yeah  i don t know   yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'no ', 'mm ', 'i don t know ', 'mine was the progress report is due on twenty third february ', 'february ', 'um yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'just looking at my own deadlines ', 'see ', 'yeah  that would be fine   wasn t like what you had now  wasn t that pretty much what we agreed on ', 'or was it just like that one ', 'okay ', 'this is illusion or whatever ', 'oh mm ', 'nice thought ', 'i m impressed ', 'maybe you should make it exist then ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'it would be nice to  i don t know  meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already  so we don t sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff ', 'just like accessing the corpus and stuff ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  yeah yeah ', 'yeah ', 'um yeah ', 'yeah ', 'next yeah  this monday ', 'just yeah ', 'it s full  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'well  it doesn t matter for me ', 'i mean three three or after what ', 'maybe we ca in four buccleuch ', 'we can go look we can look at now  afterwards ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'into what ', 'okay uh ', 'yeah ', 'oh  is that the photo copier i heard i heard about ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'so what time do we say ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'yeah  yeah  yeah ', 'okay ', 'hmm ', 'what ', 'it s true ', 'yeah  i don t know ', 'it s reading week next ', 'it should be it shouldn t be any well  it s supposed to be next week ', 'it s week six next week ', 'i don t know ', 'we have one class at least when we like speech perception  we don t have any lectures ', 'but i think we re having like all other classes ', 'so uh there s not point in having no  i think it w yeah  which are a bit crap  yeah ', 'i think the under graduates had uh all were off totally ', 'what ', 'yeah  th we will probably have it  yeah yeah ', 'last week ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  um i guess that s it ', 'was there anything else ', 'do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it ', 'yeah ', 'i don t know if there was something ', 'oh i think he basically said um the same things as in the comments  if i could read it ', 'can you read that ', 'yeah ', 'from a single application yeah ', 'well  uh that was  i guess ', 'oh ', 'no ', 'oh yeah ', 'yeah ', 'and now we have seven percent of the course already done ', 'is quite good ', 'so if y if you re okay with uh having oh ', 'who ', 'yeah   we re done now ', 'i uh is she still here ', 'yes  you are ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  exactly  yeah yeah yeah ', 'should we well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they ve been doing  how far they ve got ', 'well i hope so ', 'okay ', 'well i ve got a browser now  which whoops ', 'already gone ', 'mm hmm ', 'yeah ', 'okay ', 'so yeah ', 'we ve go a browser we ve um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics ', 'and then when you go on the menu  you can select a summarisation box  which pops up  and an audio player ', 'um and a s i think the search works as well  so you could pop up a search ', 'and it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start  you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that ', 'does that make sense ', 'um the transcription box has got a summarise but button  which doesn t do anything yet ', 'um now i wonder wh how we wanna do  you know  we want a pop up window with the speaker characterisation ', 'um either we could do that you know  when does the pop up come ', 'either we can when you click on the the i d   any sort of i d  in the transcription box  or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box  but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is ', 'the problem is the r the left click is already used because it highlights that um that part of speech or whatever that what he s been saying  you know  the the left click highlights it ', 'so that you can i don t know what happens when you double click actually  but that d be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else ', 'um i think so yeah  when you left click it  you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there  i think ', 'um so we can t put it on left click ', 'we could put it on a right click ', 'we could for example have a little menu that pops up ', 'so right click on at menu  you know  and you can click on speaker characterisation  up pops the window ', 'that s a good point ', 'i don t know ', 'nothing else ', 'yeah  yeah  but um i don t know about you  but uh usually in windows right click doesn t do anything  does it ', 'it opens a menu ', 'yeah  so yeah ', 'so but that d be yeah ', 'if you just yeah ', 'yeah ', 'um or just  you know  or just the button ', 'well no no  you still have the menu the menu pop up that well oh  yeah ', 'it s more obvious  isn t it  w what you can do ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  that s right ', 'that s true  yeah  it s more intuitive really  isn t it ', 'maybe  maybe ', 'in the beta version ', 'um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in ', 'like a search for that user ', 'is that gonna be useful or too much ', 'or yeah  so y when you right click on it  one one option will be give me all your meetings  characterise the speaker or is that too much i mean ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  that s true  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  that s true ', 'it d nice to have it inconnec interconnected like or you mean the the speaker characterisation ', 'oh well  yeah  i mean  i don t know about that ', 'i mean it s the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said ', 'i mean it s like a nice thing ', 'we don t we re not actually sure what the user wants with it  but it s interesting  so why not give it to him ', 'i i think we should do it ', 'i mean yeah  i mean that s that s still another level further ', 'i mean we re not even there yet ', 'you know  it doesn t even doesn t even pop up the speaker characterisation yet ', 'y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user ', 'yeah ', 'yes ', 'so should we try try to do a right click when you then sorry ', 'yeah ', 'yes ', 'wait ', 'yeah  there s a second thing about the topics  the topic window ', 'we wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that ', 'yeah ', 'so we could do that in a similar way  do it right click as well ', 'and to have a different menu for our yeah ', 'so yeah ', 'so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations ', 'and when then we have the interlinking by right click basically ', 'double click oh ', 'hmm ', 'yeah ', 'i don t see there s anything obvious that was that would be able  you know  that would be yeah  but then then there s the problem with a lot of windows popping up again ', 'and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is  you know what i mean ', 'yeah  maybe ', 'mm ', 'hmm ', 'especially if you have a touch pad ', 'it just goes oh ', 'well i ll i ll check what it does on on um double click at the moment ', ' cause i think it might do something ', 'but but yeah  mm but i don t i don t i d really don t see anything obvious that that would i mean if you can think of something that sorry ', 'sorry ', 'um yeah  another thing ', 'single audio files ', 'do we wanna use them or not ', 'yeah  single channel that s single channel files ', 'do we want them ', 'i mean yeah  okay  yeah  yeah ', 'i mean we might use them while wo to work with them  but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here s do you though ', 'i mean it s not gonna make much sense if you don t listen to it on its own d do you ', 'does it ', 'no  hmm ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'um yeah  wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he s mentioned ', 'do you think do you think it s really that bad ', 'that s what i feel as well ', 'i mean i m i m very much i w i wanna have everything customisable ', 'um probably not  no ', 'yeah ', 'two or three maybe  but yeah ', 'but yeah  it depends  i mean i i really wanna put the summary in somewhere  you know ', 'and the summary for example is typical ', 'you open the window  you read through it  you might click on you know  close it again straight away ', 'but it d be good to have it there ', 'i was just thinking of tab ', 'that true ', 'yea yeah yeah yeah ', 'that s right ', 'i m not sure yeah ', 'no ', 'i don t know ', 'do you reckon ', 'i m sure ', 'i m sure you could do anything ', 'hmm ', 'i can have a look ', 'but yeah  that that might be an idea  yeah ', 'hmm ', 'but i mean people get used to it  i mean when you use a windows or linux for that matter  you have a lot of windows open ', 'and you manage them ', 'yeah  you can minimise  em ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'yeah  that s true  they re they re definitely yeah  they re definitely gonna be in the same window  yeah ', 'exclusive ', 'yeah  that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway ', 'so d yeah  do you wanna do that with summaries in ', 'put the summaries in in the same window ', 'mutually exclusive with summary ', 'yeah  you wanna do that ', 'yeah ', 'and finally the prototype he spoke about ', 'what kind of prototype could we produce ', 'because i m i m just  you know  i go into the lab and i say right  what am i gonna change today ', 'you know ', 'and it kind of just it just develops  i m not aiming for anything ', 'do we wanna aim for something ', 'i m i m pretty much getting there anyway  to be honest ', 'it s not it s not gonna be a lot more work ', 'oh ', 'hmm ', 'mm true ', 'oh right  i see ', 'hmm ', 'um probably not ', 'i don t know  can you access other people s yeah  sure ', 'i don t know if it s readable at the moment  but you can sure have a d have a look ', 'alright ', ' kay ', 'right  well i ll make that readable then ', 'um so the directory is my number well  this is not difficult ', 'it s in all the emails ', 'not o  four ', 'o  four  five five five  six o  ', 'o  four five five five six o  ', 'and then um there s a folder um n l s s d   and it s called the m  browser ', 'yes  m  for meeting ', 'really ', 'no  i m i m extremely organised  you see ', 'i ve got folders for everything ', 'i love folders ', 'yep  so that s me done ', 'someone else wanna talk about their stuff ', 'mm hmm ', 'w what where you doing again ', 'the search  okay ', 'okay ', 'indexing ', 'oh ', 'oh right ', 'oh that s pretty much there  is it ', 'of making oh great ', 'yeah  that s handy ', 'so you think it shouldn t be too difficult ', 'oh  i see ', 'yeah ', 'you have to convert it to some sort of format  i suppose ', 'i mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then  because um  you know  they already extract for example transcripts ', 'put it into a window at least ', 'what do you mean ', 'this week s only two days old ', 'oh ', 'yeah ', 'oh that s complete rubbish anyway ', 'never mind ', 'just so stupid ', 'mm hmm ', 'well ye the browser as i use it now or as uh  you know  it was there when i took it um uses the um the n x t  search to get the data out of the out the files  which i think is odd  but i m not quite sure how it works yet ', 'i don t quite understand it ', 'to get the data i for example to get the summarisation data  you have to search for i think the i d s or something ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'so they don t  you know  they don t say look in that and that folder  but they say search everything ', 'oh it does load up quite quickly ', 'so you know  it s not too bad ', 'but you know  you could have a look at them ', 'no  this is not the actual search ', 'this is just when you open what you know  to load the transcript for example  to find the transcript for a certain meeting  it does does an n x t  search for the string  i don t know  transcript or text or whatever ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  so i don t know if you ve looked at the search query s language  but it s like a dollar a  text say ', 'yeah ', 'and then yeah ', 'because every every of all of these um these files have got um tha an i d  ', 'and all the transcript files have got the string  i don t know what it is  words or text or something in it  so it just searches for those files ', 'vaguely ', 'so open ', 'um um well  it s in the code ', 'just that it  you know  it yeah  you define a search object  and then you search on that string ', 'i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary ', 'that s how i i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself ', 'yeah  just search for a specific string ', 'so you could just  you know  you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere ', 'yeah ', 'if you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna  you know  whatever you wanna do  then just send me an email ', 'i can explain it ', 'oh yeah ', 'actually  in the moment it s got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that i used from this from you know  that they gave us  had a lot of extra stuff in  and i haven t dared throwing out to through out all the functions i haven t you know  that i don t need ', 'yeah  just in case ', 'exactly ', 'yes ', 'so they re all in there ye still ', 'a lot of rubbish  but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end  i think ', 'yes ', 'exactly  yes ', 'yeah ', 'precisely ', 'the weekend ', 'the weekend s still four days off ', 'oh ', 'i don t actually have that much to do at the moment ', 'well oh dear ', 'well i can t remember what i m supposed to do  by the way ', 'am i supposed to do the summarisation thingibob ', 'no ', 'you do ', 'well  i ll do that then ', 'shall i do that then ', 'i mean or you know it shouldn t be to difficult ', 'i mean well i m doing communications  which we had one exercise and i ve done that like two weeks ago ', 'and that s in in two weeks ', 'yeah  it s a nine nine course as well or ten or something ', 'yeah ', 'and then then i m doing parallel programming languages and systems  which we had one exercise as well  and that s in like friday ', 'well i m not doing any background reading  so you know ', 'being lazy ', 'oh ', 'yeah  if you like ', 'we can always decide then  i mean yeah ', 'yeah ', 'um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then ', 'you re gonna do the search ', 'you re gonna implement the search ', 'everything ', 'mm hmm ', 'it s just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones  because otherwise you know weeks will go by and well you decide  i m not doing much for that prototype ', 'so of oh ', 'well  how about we get it done by then ', 'i mean then we can write about it in the in the interim report  and s you know  and then we ve got something to show ', 'um oh and the the search interface ', 'maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for ', 'and then if you want  you can give that to me and i ll i ll build a u nice  you know  a few tick boxes and drop down menus ', 'no ', 'oh that s that s that doesn t exist ', 'tha that s completely cut and pasted ', 'that does not exist ', 'nicely done though  isn t it ', 'it s actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know  all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google online ', 'a screen shot of google ', 'it s just so much fun ', 'it s gonna be a little difficult more difficult ', 'yeah  i mean i was going to  but you know  the whole drop down menus and stuff  what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on ', 'we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for ', 'so yeah  do you wanna  you know  just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do  and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include ', 'that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do ', 'know know already what ', 'oh ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  i can do that ', 'show you what bits the code yeah ', 'ah  yeah ', 'well this time i m dictating the time   cause i if i m not there you can t do anything ', 'yeah  ah it s not gonna take an hour to explain it  you know ', 'i mean pick a time ', 'i i you know  let me know  whenever ', 'what monday ', 'what did you say ', 'three o clock ', 'actually th yeah ', 'unless you wanna do it after the um after d  d  and a  ', 'that s gonna be tight ', 'yeah  it what front door ', 'i ve not found that yet ', 'really ', 'really ', 'ah ', 'well  i m just i ve got it in my computer ', 'whatever is in my computer ', 'i just think it s better to do it afterwards ', 'then we have all the time we need ', 'rather than have half an hour and then we ll surely run out ', 'oh ', 'actually it s not even confirmed yet ', 'what was she doesn t even know what she s talking about yet  i think ', 'maybe it doesn t happen at all ', 'is it really ', 'really ', 'i don t think we have a reading week though ', 'the the yeah  i don t think there is an official i don t think there was an official one last semester ', 'i think it was just a bank holiday  wasn t it ', 'no  okay ', 'let s meet monday ', 'hmm ', 'right ', 'i think we need to tick the okay box  right ', 'ooh ', 'exciting ', 'should we turn these off then or what ', 'funky sh stuff like that ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'look at all this stuff man ', 'okay ', 'right ', 'has anybody has anybody done anything ', 'you better start ', 'good at this ', 'right ', 'd yeah ', 'the l the left click or the right click ', 'right ', 'yeah  it might be quite good  i suppose ', 'yeah ', 'what else could we have in the menu ', 'okay ', 'so otherwise you just have a right click or do you have have a is a window ', 'a menu  yeah yeah ', 'yeah  it s why ', 'and so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'it s more it s more idiot proof  isn t it ', 'it s got a button ', 'add more buttons ', 'yeah ', 'well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one  you can have a menu instead of a button but this why i don t think it yeah ', 'yep ', 'i guess so ', 'so what did you part of the m the menu that comes down  it says give me all your meetings or something ', 'yep ', 'i guess so ', 'it s an idea ', 'get to use my pen ', 'yeah yeah ', 'oh yeah ', 'we have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges ', 'so yeah  there you go ', 'yeah ', 'alright ', 'why not ', 'even if only one thing comes up ', 'okay ', 'so and so this lot is for um on the t speaker ', 'and then this lot is on th what was that ', 'i didn t quite understand ', 'do you mean yeah ', 'oh  so and it figures out what s the most common use to double click ', 'oh ', 'okay ', 'yeah ', 'sometimes you do it by accident though ', 'you  oh go away ', 'stop coming up ', 'yeah ', 'no ', 'yeah  yeah  oh yeah ', 't throw stuff throwing out the window ', 'yep ', 'we don t know yet do we  i don t think ', 'do you mean the single channel ', 'probably not  but we might need them for disfluencies  if we try do it in audio ', 'but at the moment  no ', 'but yeah ', 'we might want to be able to say oh  just give me what that person s saying ', 'unless um you can t hear it properly or something ', 'somebody s talking over somebody else or something ', 'well p w we just say no for now and put it in later or something ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'yeah   cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot  won t it ', 'therefore print will be bigger ', 'yeah ', 'no  i think it s i think it s fine ', 'yeah ', 'i think what we re doing is fine ', 'yeah  tabs are good ', 'mozilla style ', 'yeah ', 'does anybody know how to do that ', 'or can you do that in java ', 'i don t think java knows how to do that really ', 'maybe yeah  you probably can ', 'but but if you really knew what you re doing ', 'but i don t know ', 'it s a bit of a cripple with java s windowing tool kit ', 'the eight is sometimes it s a bit of a cripple ', 'yeah ', 'yeah yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  that will reduce the number of um windows we needed  wouldn t it ', 'which is quite good ', ' cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows  if you ever use photoshop it s got loads  and you re always g forever going no  get out of the way ', 'there s always stuff in the way  isn t there ', 'so yeah ', 'you do  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'unless  can you i don t suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you can you do that ', 'okay  well it s alright then ', 'yeah ', 'of course you can actually  yeah  it s got everything ', 'yeah  sounds good ', 'um yeah  that s what we need  yeah ', 'something just slightly more than just that on its own ', 'yep ', 'yep  definitely ', 'i think that s kinda as well  isn t it really ', 'seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be a prototype with a gui ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'you can make it if you make it world readable  then anybody can access it ', 'yeah ', 'no  uh i i it no  they re not world readable ', 'it not the default they re only default then only you can read them by default ', 'you can see them but you can t read them ', 'yeah ', 'what s your number ', 'okay  your number ', 'okay ', 'and then it s n l s s d  ', 'the m  browser  for meeting ', 'hope you hope you never have to look in my directory ', 'it s just pure chaos ', 's mine is serious chaos ', 'files everywhere ', 'don t all jump at once ', 'yeah ', 'yeah  what was on it ', 'oh you found some code for it ', 'for the inde alright ', 'alright ', 'cool  cool ', 'so even if it doesn t work  you can jiggery pokery around and make it work ', 'y yeah ', 'yeah yeah ', 'all sorts of nonsense ', 'but yeah ', 'by the basics is uh oh okay  that s good ', 'yeah ', 'i ve been trying to g write something to read the x m l  and get rid of it ', 'and i can get rid of it  but i m having trouble putting it anywhere else ', 'so it will come up on the screen for the moment i haven t managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it ', 'but i guess it s not very difficult ', 'yeah  in java  yeah ', 'yeah ', 'yeah yeah  i m sure they do ', 'yeah ', 'yeah ', 'oh yeah  i will ', 'i m sure it s nothing difficult ', 'i m sure i m making a meal of it at the moment actually ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'absolutely  yeah ', 'should share as much as possible ', 'yeah yep ', 'next week sometime  yeah ', 'i actually haven t done anything this week  cause this week s been manic ', 'but well  whatever it was  last week then ', 'the the the week as it as is rather than the proper week  do you know what i mean ', 'do you know that  it s been all a bit manic  the last m the last yeah ', 'yeah  that s right  yeah ', 'and then we had to do an i r p   whatever it was last week as well ', 'which is only a page long  but it s quite difficult to write a page ', 'more diffi it was  it wasn t marked  but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit  which is a bit irritating ', 'yeah  but s p n l p  ', 'yeah ', 'yep ', 'so when it when it that s pretty bizarre  isn t it ', 'well i guess that s how it works ', 'they ve got d that is pretty bizarre ', 'yeah  yeah ', 'that is pretty bizarre ', 'wh four  and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list  whatever  find everything that s got that and then load yeah ', 'yeah  yeah   cause that s the uh the declares a variable  doesn t it  and then they keep okay ', 'right ', 'oh see  obvious so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it  is that what you did ', 'right ', 'okeydoke ', 'fish the data  i was just thinking that  yeah ', 'mm ', 'have you annotated your code nicely ', 'not yet ', 'just in case ', 'mission critical ', 'yeah ', 'commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it  does it work  yeah ', 'okay  get rid of that  next ', 'good fun  aye ', 'so basically we go and go and do some work really  i think that s the um the um the answer to that  isn t it ', 'the long and the short of it ', 'yeah ', 'proba i m still at the bottom of the mountain ', 'yeah ', 'well  should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising ', 'you saw it  yeah ', 'so what courses should i pick to be not doing any work at the moment ', 'yeah ', 'oh  so it s uh  yeah ', 'yeah
